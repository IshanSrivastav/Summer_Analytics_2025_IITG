# ðŸš— Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Spaces (Real-Time with Pathway)

This project simulates real-time dynamic pricing for urban parking lots using Pathway's stream processing engine. The system ingests streaming data, computes demand-based features, and outputs pricing predictions in real time with interactive Bokeh visualizations.
