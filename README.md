This project simulates real-time dynamic pricing for urban parking lots using Pathway's stream processing engine. The system ingests streaming data, computes demand-based features, and outputs pricing predictions in real time with interactive Bokeh visualizations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Models Used

### üîπ Model 1: Baseline Linear Pricing

A simple linear model to serve as a pricing baseline.

**Formula:**

price = BASE_PRICE + Œ± √ó (occupancy / capacity) 

**Behavior:**  
Linearly increases price with occupancy.

---

### üîπ Model 2: Demand-Based Pricing

A more advanced pricing model using multiple real-time demand indicators.

**Demand Factors:**

- Occupancy  
- Queue Length  
- Traffic Level  
- Special Day (binary)  
- Vehicle Type (weight-based)

**Price Formula:**

price = BASE + (normalized_demand √ó Œª √ó BASE)

**Weights Used:**

- Occupancy: `0.4`  
- Queue: `0.3`  
- Traffic: `0.15`  
- Special Day: `0.1`  
- Vehicle Type: `0.05`

## üìâ Visualizations

Real-time interactive **Bokeh** plots display predicted prices for each parking lot.

- Each lot is shown in a **dedicated Panel tab**
- Plots **update automatically** as new data arrives via Pathway streaming
- Uses **tumbling daily windows** (`1-day interval`) for aggregation
